### Welcome to Gome Bio âœ¨!

Together teaching the immune system to fight disease 

# Description
Gome Bio, a science-driven biotechnology firm advances first-in-class therapeutics and develops state-of-the-art technologies in order to treat serious life-threatening diseases and disabilities such as respiratory cancers (NSCLC, SCLC), lower respiratory infections (LRI), neurological conditions, HIV/AIDS, and preterm birth complications. 

# Mission Statement
We are committed to helping people with severe diseases and conditions realize the promise of personalized medicine, cellular therapies, and vaccines. Our mission is to continue to set the foundation to become the industry leader in immunoengineering, computer-aided design/diagnostics (CAD) for genomes, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotechnology. 

# Detailed Description
Gome Bio does immunoengineering to use your own immune system to fight disease and bioengineering next-generation CAD for genomes to cure disease through genetic code writing. Artificial intelligence (AI) for vaccine design and development alongside quantum vaccinomics will accompany our structural biology division. Gome Bio will offer immune instructive materials, gene designs and diagnostics, and next-generation vaccines by combing computing, science, and machine learning. Gome Bio is located in the Tri-Valley in California.
